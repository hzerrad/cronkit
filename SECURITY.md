## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing [security contact email] or by opening a private security advisory on GitHub.

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Considerations

Cronkit is a read-only tool that never executes or modifies crontabs. It is designed to be safe to use on production systems for auditing and documentation purposes.

However, please report any security concerns, including:
- Potential code injection vulnerabilities
- File system access issues
- Input validation problems
- Any other security-related concerns

We take security seriously and will respond to reports promptly.
